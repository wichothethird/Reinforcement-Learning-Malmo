# Reinforcement-Learning-Malmo
In this assignment, we have simulated a reinforcement learning based dog, whose lifeâ€™s purpose, as it tends to be, is to please its owner. You will define the details of the Markov Decision Process, and use the provided implementation of Q-Learning to learn a policy. Then, you will extend the MDP with more states and actions, and see if how well you can get the agent to do.
